Bandwidth - is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
Throughput - is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
Latency - refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.
Computer - an electronic system that operated by commands stored in its own memory. It can accepts data(inputs), process data through specified rules, produce information (output), and store for future use.
Characteristics : 
    • Speed - can process data at the rate of millions of instructions per second.
    • Accuracy - offers high degree of precision.
    • Diligence - doesn't get tired
    • Storage Capability - store large quantities of data and information.
    • Versatility - naturally flexible. Can perform various task/activities.
Viruses - is a very small malicious software that hides in real programs.
    E-mail Viruses - spreads to e-mail messages as an attachment.
    Trojan Horses - a program for computer. Claims to do one thing, but when executed it does harm instead.
    Worms - a tiny piece of software that replicates itself using computer networks and security holes. It uses the security holes replicating itself from to the new computer.
Reasons for Building a Computer:
    1. To save money.
    2. Personally choose reliable components.
    3. Personalized design.
    4. Within your budget.
    5. Easier to upgrade.

4 Main Steps in DHCP
    • Discover
    • Offer
    • Request
    • Acknowledge
APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing - client assigning ip to itself when DHCP server doesn't respond to the client request for IPs.

Class-Based Network
   • Class A: 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 - default subnet mask /8
   • Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.25.255 - default subnet mask /16
   • Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 - default subnet mask /24

Private IPv4 IPs
   • 10.0.0.0/8 - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
   • 172.16.0.0/12 - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
   • 192.168.0.0/16 - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

DEFAULT TTL FOR DEVICES
   • WINDOWS PC: 128
   • ROUTERS: 255

VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) Modes
   • Client - can't change its VLAN configuration (cannot create or delete VLANs). But can process and forward vlans.
   • Server - can create and delete VLANs. This is the default mode for cisco switches.

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
   - is a layer 2 network protocol designed to prevents loops in Ethernet networks while allowing for link redundancy.
   - ensures there's only one active logical path between any two devices.
