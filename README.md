## 01. Installing Cisco Packet Tracer
### Visit their official website by clicking 👾<a href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer">here</a>👾.<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Create your own Cisco account by registering through any email accounts or via google account. Then, click their module for <b>Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer</b> which will give you the installation link of the software witihn its modular. Once installed, login the account you created and you can now start learning.</p>

## 02. Connecting 2 PCs with a Cross FastEthernet Cable

## TERMINOLOGY

  <li>
    <b>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)</b> - is a Cisco proprietary protocol. Considered to be easier to configure and manage than OSPF. It uses a <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">hybrid routing protocol</b> that combines features of both <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">distance vector</b> and <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">link-state</b> routing protocols. To calculate the best path to a destination, it uses a composite metric that takes into account factors such as bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load. Supports different  network topologies, including hub-and-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh.

    <b>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</b> - is an open standard protocol. Suited for larger networks with complex topologies. It uses <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">pure link-state</b> protocol. To calculate the best path to a destination, OSPF uses a cost-based metric that is calculated based on the bandwith of the links.
